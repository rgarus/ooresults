ooresults
---------

ooresults (open orienteering results) is a software to compute the results of orienteering events.
Here, "open" stands for "Open Source" (licensed under AGPL) on the one hand,
and for "Open Architecture" (extendable by plugins) on the other.
ooresults is able to read SPORTident cards.

ooresults uses Python 3.8+ and is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, version 3.
It consists of two programs:

- **ooresults-server**

   ooresults-server is a web server for managing and storing data. It uses TCP ports 8080 and 8081.

- **ooresults-reader**

   ooresults-reader reads the data of a SI-Card with the help of a connected SPORTident readout station
   and sends the data to the ooresults-server.

The operation takes place by means of a current web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, ...).

ooresults was successfully used to compute the results of the SILVA O-Night 2023 in Munich.
