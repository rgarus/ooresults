Welcome to the ooresults developer documentation!
=================================================

ooresults (open orienteering results) is a software to compute the results of orienteering events.
Here, “open” stands for “Open Source” (licensed under AGPL) on the one hand,
and for “Open Architecture” (extendable by plugins) on the other.
ooresults is able to read SPORTident cards.

ooresults uses Python 3.8+ and is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, version 3.
It is operated using a current web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, ...).
